"""Ambient chat: one line from one bot, overheard in /say or a public channel, in its own voice.

A whitelisted player says "hi everyone" near some bots. The worldserver module picks the bots in earshot, and for each one
asks this service (POST /ambient) what it would say. Each bot answers from its own personality and memories, sees what the
others have already said in the same place, and may stay silent. The module staggers the answers and lets a bot answer
another bot's line a few times, so the street talks among itself and then goes quiet.

Nothing here touches the tools or the bot's remembered conversations: it is cheap, short, and forgotten.
