"""A bank of prewritten chat lines, so a busy realm can talk without an LLM call per line.

Lines are written once, in bulk, by a model: every kind of person (see personas.py) times every situation a player meets
in chat, some of them idle ("lfg dungeon", "wts cloth", a gripe about the zone) and some replies to a kind of line (a
greeting, a question, a joke). Choosing one at runtime costs nothing when done locally, and about $0.00002 when Jev picks
among a dozen candidates so that the answer fits what was just said.

A line may hold placeholders that are filled in when it is said: {player} {zone} {class} {level} {link}. {link} is the
item or quest the game already named in the stock line, so loot and quest situations stay accurate.
