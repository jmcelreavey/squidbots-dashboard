"""Roleplay mode: every bot is a person in the world of Warcraft, with a life.

A bot gets a character the first time it is seen with its race and class (the worldserver module sends them): a calling that
suits its class and race, a temperament, a way of speaking, convictions, a goal, a few people in its life, a keepsake, a fear. The
same guid always rolls the same character. A model later writes the story out in full from those facts, and as the bot levels
it writes new chapters about what the person did in that stretch of life, so the story goes on growing and never contradicts
what came before. If no model is reachable, templates stand in, so the character is never blank.

What the model is shown each time a bot speaks (see `persona_block`): who it is, what its people believe and think of others,
its story so far, and where it is right now: the zone and its lore, what it is busy with and the errands in its log.

Everything here is plain data in lore.py and lore_names.py; this file holds the machinery.
