"""The roleplay line bank: prewritten in-character lines, based on Warcraft lore, for every race and calling.

It sits in the same table as the player-style bank (see bank.py) under its own archetype keys:

    rp:<Race>:<calling>   what one kind of character says in each situation (40 of them: four callings for each of ten races)
    rpz:<Race>            what a person of that race says about each zone they might be standing in (situation rp_zone:<Zone>)

A line is spoken aloud by someone living in the world, so none of them mentions levels, dungeon finders, servers or any of the
other words a player at a keyboard would use. They may use {player}, {zone}, {class}, {friend}, {link} and {mob} where the
situation allows, and nothing else.
